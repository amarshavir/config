# Setup Script

add stuff here some time idk

# DO NOT

ever install nerd-fonts-source-code-pro
it sucks and messes up font awesome rendering

# Special Notes

Since Nvchad exists on a folder that needs to be changed by its own repo
which means to nvchad config folder needs to be symbolically linked, I.E.

```bash
ln -s ~/config/nvchad/ ~/config/.config/nvim/lua/custom
```
